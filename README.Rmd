# fontgis: A simple way to use GIS icons in R for spatial visualisation and analysis

Insert 'Font-GIS' icon sets into 'R Markdown' documents, 'Quarto' files, and 'Shiny' applications in a simple and flexible way.The icons, designed for GIS and spatial analysis themes, can be integrated as 'SVG' elements or HTML '<i>' tags.They can also be exported as 'PNG' images for use in contexts requiring raster graphics.

The goal of fontgis is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of fontgis like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(fontgis)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
